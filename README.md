# Movies-ETL

For the Hackathon hosted by Amazing Prime, a large database of movies was required. Using the ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) process, we were able to use Python to clean, consolidate, and upload the data to a Postgres database. In this repo you will find:

* Exploratory data analysis to determine the best approach to perform ETL on the movie data. (wiki_dump and Ratings_dump)

* 4 Jupyter files that iteratively combines the ETL process into one large Python function that can be run multiple times to update the data on an on going basis (any file with ETL in the name)
